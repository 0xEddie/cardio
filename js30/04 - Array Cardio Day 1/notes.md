# 04 - Array Cardio Day 1
## Array Method Exercises

Today is just practicing with JavaScript array methods (filter, sort, map, reduce) for muscle memory.

- to sort an array in place WITHOUT modifying the original array (mutation), use the new array method `toSorted` instead of the usual method `sort`
- `reduce` usually turns into an inscrutable mess, so often it is better to just use a `for` loop
- in question 6, user has to navigate to the wikipedia page because sending a fetch request from and outside origin will get blocked by CORS
