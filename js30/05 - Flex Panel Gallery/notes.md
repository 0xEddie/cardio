# 05 - Flex Panel Gallery
- flexbox will autosize the width of children to min-content, set `flex: 1` to let `flex-grow` to get the flex children to expand and share the full available space
- good to throw the ol `border: 1px solid red;` on the text blocks when adjusting their layout
- good example of nesting flexboxes
	- `.panel` is the parent flex container of children `.panels`
	- `.panels` is the parent flex container of the `<p>` elements
- checking for `transitionend` of a flex event transition is kinda scuffed
	- Safari transitionend `event.propertyName === flex`
	- Chrome + FF transitionend `event.propertyName === flex-grow`
	- therefore just check if e.propertyName `includes` 'flex', don't check for a specific property
- As a bonus I'm trying to remove the `open` and `open-active` classes from `.panel`s when a new `.panel` is clicked, but the `open-active` class is inconsistent in being toggled
	- I think one way to fix this, while retaining the same transition flow of the text floating down *after* `open` is done being applied, is to make `open-active` its own separate CSS transition (just on a delay of 0.5s) and then fire it on the `click` event not the `transitionend` event
